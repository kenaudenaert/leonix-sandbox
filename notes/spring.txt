Spring 2.5 added support for JSR-250 annotations such as @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy.
Spring 3.0 added support for JSR-330 annotations such as @Inject and @Named.

Like @Resource, the @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotation types were a part of the standard
Java libraries from JDK 6 to 8. However, the entire javax.annotation package got separated from
the core Java modules in JDK 9 and eventually removed in JDK 11. (use jakarta-annotations-api).
